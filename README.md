I wanted to work on both my scripting and learn more about ICS/SCADA Hacking/Pentesting. It is an enumeration script I am building that may be a useful tool. This script uses nmap and nmap must be installed for this to work. Also please run script with sudo privileges. I am super excited about this and hope the project becomes larger soon.
